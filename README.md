# Script_to_export_Oracle_table_data
You will need to replace the placeholders path/to/oracle/home, username, password, and dbname with the appropriate values for your system and database. You will also need to replace table_name with the name of the table you want to export.

This script uses SQLPlus to connect to the Oracle database and generate an XML file using the DBMS_XMLGEN package. The SPOOL command is used to redirect the output of the SQL query to a file called table_name.xml. The SET commands are used to configure the SQLPlus output to remove unnecessary formatting.

Once the script completes, you should see a message indicating that the table has been exported to table_name.xml.
